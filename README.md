# AIO
An all-in-one pod that acts as a home server.

Main functionality:
* chat-bot (telegram)
* clock (via a 32x16 rgb-matrix)
* dashboard (via external browser)

## Chatbot
Periodically calls the telegram api and reacts to sent commands. Also handles calls to the hw-output. 

Might add the functionality to monitor chats and make advanced statistics.

## Clock
Refreshes the matrix with useful information: time, date (weekdays), weather. I'm running out of ideas...

## Dashboard
TODO
